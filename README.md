# meritmoot

meritmoot was a project dedicated to providing a platform for policy discussion on the internet. The project is still ongoing, but has pivoted in a diffrent direction away from the base technology it utilized: [discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). Meritmoot was a plugin for discourse.

The idea of meritmoot was to provide a platform for:
  - local political discussion and information within a state
  - national political discussion
  - bill and roll call information
  
As I learnt more about ruby on rails, I realized that it was not feasible to continue with discourse. Discourse is an amazing platform, but it was not compatible with my end vision for the site, which needed more flexibility. I am thankful for the open and helpful [discourse community](meta.discourse.org) for all the help they provided.

## Installation

I wouldn't suggest it as it is unstable, but if so, look at: [Install a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157) and other posts on [meta](meta.discourse.org). Rather, I would suggest looking at certain sections of the code for reference when doing similar bulk-api activities.

## Feedback

If you have issues or suggestions for the plugin, send me a message.
